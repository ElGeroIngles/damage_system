# Custom Stats System

This datapack is for all of the datapack developers who need a custom stats system but doesn't know how to do it.

## Features

- Custom weapon stats
- Multiplayer compatibility

## Credits:

This datapack uses a datapack from [Cloud Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/@CloudWolfMinecraft) that basicly allows us to detect who the attacker is and who is the victim, I know that we have **/execute on** but this datapack was developed before that command was introduced, nonetheless it still works and it very powerfull. You can check out his datapack [here](https://youtu.be/YZfCBBvOMN4).

## How to use

I made a video in my youtube channel explaining how it works and how to add custom weapons, armor and mobs with custom stats.

## Known bugs

It is not an actual bug but its important that I say it: Don't do /reload when wearing a custom armor, this is due to the fact that in **reload.mcfunction** we reset the stats of the player, just remove that and put it in a separate function.
